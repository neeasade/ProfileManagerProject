# FPT2S15
This is a profile manager for a [digital wallet](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~daswani/wallets/) implementation, worked on by myself, @Avd6977, and @atsteven. This was done as part of a final project for a class at KSU, and is not meant to be used outside of that. I am putting it here for posterity and to demonstrate my default c# coding style as of 6/22/2015.

#ProfileManager
This branch adds three projects to the Wallet-Team2 solution: ProfileManagerLib, ProfileManagerTestView, ProfileManagerDiagram. Within the ProfileManagerDiagram project there is a folder 'design' containing the test cases and state diagram for the ProfileManager.
